# Step 1 — In your repo, replace .binder/Dockerfile with this EXACT content:
FROM manimcommunity/manim:stable

# install Jupyter pieces as root
USER root
RUN python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir notebook jupyterlab ipywidgets

# copy your repository into the image and set ownership to the existing manimuser
COPY --chown=manimuser:manimuser . /manim

# run Binder as the existing non-root user and work from /manim
USER manimuser
WORKDIR /manim

# Step 2 — Commit and push these changes to your GitHub repository.

# Step 3 — Relaunch your Binder link (with a cache-buster, e.g. &fresh=1). 
# You should now see your notebooks in the file browser and be able to open and run them.
